# MongoDB Key Learning Project
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to MongoDB, aimed at building a solid foundation in NoSQL database concepts. The focus is on understanding core operations, data modeling strategies, and how MongoDB integrates within a full-stack application.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to explore MongoDB through practical implementation. By simulating real-world scenarios such as sending, editing/updating, deleting chats and adding new chats, this project demonstrates how to effectively structure and interact with a document-based database.

## How It Works

### Database Initialization
A MongoDB database is initialized with one collections (chats) to simulate real-world data scenarios.

### CRUD Operations
The application implements full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality using MongoDB queries or via Mongoose, a popular ODM for Node.js.

### Data Modeling
Document schemas are designed to reflect flexible, scalable data structures — showcasing MongoDB’s strengths over traditional relational databases.

### Backend Integration
A minimal backend (built with Node.js and Express) is used to handle API requests and communicate with the MongoDB database.

### Validation
API endpoints and database interactions are validated through custom scripts or middleware to ensure data integrity.

## Technologies Used
-MongoDB
-Node.js + Express
-Mongoose (for schema modeling and easier database interaction)
-JavaScript

## Key Learnings
-Gained practical experience with MongoDB syntax and architecture
-Learned how to design flexible schemas for unstructured data
-Implemented CRUD operations and RESTful APIs
-Understood the role of MongoDB in modern full-stack development
